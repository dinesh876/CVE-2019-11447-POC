CuteNews 2.1.2 - CVE-2019-11447 Proof-Of-Concept

POC by CRFSlick, discovered by AkkuS <Özkan Mustafa Akkuş>

> An issue was discovered in CutePHP CuteNews 2.1.2. An attacker can infiltrate the server 
through the avatar upload process in the profile area via the avatar_file field to 
index.php?mod=main&opt=personal. There is no effective control of $imgsize in 
/core/modules/dashboard.php. The header content of a file can be changed and the control 
can be bypassed for code execution. (An attacker can use the GIF header for this.)
